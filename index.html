<!DOCTYPE html> <!--This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. In this case, <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that the document is HTML5.-->

<html lang="en-NO"> <!--The <html> tag is the root element of the HTML document. The lang="en" attribute specifies that the language of the document is English. This can help with accessibility and search engine optimization.-->

<!--Remember: to add a link, use '<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">name-of-webpage</a>' (without the '' tags).

    Remember: to add a picture, use '<img src="img_example.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="a picture used as an code-traning example">' (without the '' tags).
        The 'width="500" height="600"' specify the width and height of the image (in pixels).
        The 'alt="a picture used as an code-traning example"' specifies an alternate text for an image..

    If you want to link to a picture that is already within the domain (called a Relative URL), the code changes to this,
    '<img src="/pictures/img_example.jpg">' (without the '' tags). It is almost always best to use relative URLs as they will not break if you change domain.-->
